# Vital-Mine-Care
A real-time Mine Health Monitoring System built with Node.js, Next.js, and Arduino. It tracks environmental and structural conditions using sensors (e.g., load cell, moisture sensor) connected to an ESP8266. Data is sent to Firebase for storage and visualization, ensuring miner safety with continuous updates.
